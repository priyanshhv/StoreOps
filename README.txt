you are the sql database designer working at google you have to improve my design of tables and their interrelation also tell me how I am going to achieve my business. So first I have User table having id, firstname, lastname, email(unique = true), dateOfBirth, password, accountLocked, enabled, balance,created_date(nullable = false, updatable = false) and last_modified_date(insertable = false). Second I have Store table having id, name, address, location, owner_id, store_balance. Third I have Machine table having id, store_id, average_cost_per_hour, isOn(true or false). Fourth I have Booking table having id, user_id, machine_id, created_date(nullable = false, updatable = false), start_time(nullable = false, updatable = false), end_time(nullable = false, updatable = false), total_amount. Fifth I have Transaction table having id, booking_id, amount created_date(nullable = false, updatable = false), start_time(nullable = false, updatable = false), end_time(insertable = false). Sixth I have Role table having id and name. So first user will register having role as User. And he can open Store also and while creating Store his role will be added as Owner and that store having its user id. And after that store owner can create new machines. Now any normal User can book the machine haivng for some start time and end time if the slot is available.
And that user can only create the transaction if the booking is made by him at this point of time (btw start time and endtime) and we will mark that machine isON as true(means now machine can start working). Now user can stop the machine by updating the endtime of that transaction and making isON as false in that machine now amount charged can be calculated in that transaction and also that amount is increased in the booking amount. Also if the user forgot to stop the machine the endtime of the Booking will takes care of it also of the transaction done.
Now I want to efficiently find the bookings done by me on that particular day also how much I spend in every transaction I did on that particular day . And bookigs can be done in free slots(which can be found out by finding bookings on that day and see their start time and end time and return the slots you can book like 2-5, 12-24 etc for that day only.
How efficiently I can do these operations and desing the db also suggest me how to do achieve these functionalities in tables and their relationships.

Thank you for providing the detailed information about your database design and business requirements. I'll review your current design, suggest improvements, and provide recommendations on how to achieve your business goals efficiently.
Improved Database Design:

User Table:

id (PK)
firstname
lastname
email (unique)
dateOfBirth
password (hashed)
accountLocked
enabled
balance
created_date (nullable = false, updatable = false)
last_modified_date (insertable = false)


Store Table:

id (PK)
name
address
location (consider using a geographic data type)
owner_id (FK to User.id)
store_balance


Machine Table:

id (PK)
store_id (FK to Store.id)
average_cost_per_hour
isOn (boolean)


Booking Table:

id (PK)
user_id (FK to User.id)
machine_id (FK to Machine.id)
created_date (nullable = false, updatable = false)
start_time (nullable = false, updatable = false)
end_time (nullable = false, updatable = false)
total_amount


Transaction Table:

id (PK)
booking_id (FK to Booking.id)
amount
created_date (nullable = false, updatable = false)
start_time (nullable = false, updatable = false)
end_time (insertable = false)


Role Table:

id (PK)
name


UserRole Table (new):

user_id (PK, FK to User.id)
role_id (PK, FK to Role.id)



Improvements and Recommendations:

User-Role Relationship:

Add a new UserRole table to implement a many-to-many relationship between users and roles. This allows users to have multiple roles (e.g., User and Owner).


Indexing:

Add indexes on frequently queried columns, such as user_id, machine_id, and start_time in the Booking table.
Add indexes on created_date and start_time in the Transaction table.


Constraints:

Add foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity (e.g., booking.user_id references user.id).
Add check constraints to ensure end_time is always greater than start_time in Booking and Transaction tables.


Data Types:

Use appropriate data types for each column (e.g., DECIMAL for balance and amount, TIMESTAMP for date/time fields).


Partitioning:

Consider partitioning large tables like Booking and Transaction by date range to improve query performance.



Achieving Business Functionalities:

User Registration and Store Creation:

When a user registers, insert a record into the User table and the UserRole table with the "User" role.
When a user creates a store, insert a record into the Store table and add the "Owner" role to the UserRole table for that user.


Machine Creation:

Store owners can insert records into the Machine table with their store_id.


Booking Creation:

Insert a record into the Booking table with user_id, machine_id, start_time, and end_time.
Check for conflicts with existing bookings before insertion.


Transaction Handling:

Insert a record into the Transaction table when a booking starts.
Update the Machine.isOn status to true.
When the user stops the machine or the booking ends:
a. Update the Transaction.end_time and calculate the amount.
b. Update the Booking.total_amount.
c. Update the Machine.isOn status to false.
d. Update the User.balance.


Finding User Bookings and Transactions for a Specific Day:

Create an index on Booking.user_id and Booking.start_time.
Use a query like:
sqlCopySELECT * FROM Booking
WHERE user_id = ? AND DATE(start_time) = ?
ORDER BY start_time;

For transactions:
sqlCopySELECT t.* FROM Transaction t
JOIN Booking b ON t.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.user_id = ? AND DATE(t.created_date) = ?
ORDER BY t.created_date;



Finding Available Slots:

Create a stored procedure or application logic to:
a. Fetch all bookings for a given machine and date.
b. Sort them by start_time.
c. Iterate through the bookings, identifying gaps between end_time of one booking and start_time of the next.
d. Return these gaps as available slots.


Efficient Queries:

Use appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns.
Consider using materialized views for complex, frequently-run queries.
Implement caching at the application level for frequently accessed data.


Data Consistency:

Use transactions when updating related tables (e.g., Booking, Transaction, and User balance updates).


Scalability:

Consider sharding the database by geographic location or time range if the system grows significantly.


Monitoring and Optimization:

Regularly analyze query performance and optimize slow queries.
Monitor table growth and adjust indexing strategies as needed.



These improvements and recommendations should help you achieve your business goals more efficiently while maintaining data integrity and scalability. Remember to test thoroughly and optimize based on real-world usage patterns.

Certainly. I'll provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to achieve all the business functionalities you've described:

User Registration:
a. Create a new record in the User table:

Generate a unique ID
Insert user details (firstname, lastname, email, dateOfBirth, hashed password)
Set accountLocked = false, enabled = true, balance = 0
Set created_date to current timestamp
b. Insert a record into the UserRole table:
user_id: the ID of the newly created user
role_id: the ID corresponding to the "User" role


Store Creation:
a. Insert a new record into the Store table:

Generate a unique ID
Insert store details (name, address, location)
Set owner_id to the current user's ID
Set store_balance to 0
b. Insert a new record into the UserRole table:
user_id: the ID of the current user
role_id: the ID corresponding to the "Owner" role


Machine Creation (by Store Owner):
a. Verify that the current user has the "Owner" role
b. Insert a new record into the Machine table:

Generate a unique ID
Set store_id to the owner's store ID
Insert machine details (average_cost_per_hour)
Set isOn to false


Booking Creation:
a. Receive booking request (user_id, machine_id, start_time, end_time)
b. Check for conflicting bookings:
sqlCopySELECT COUNT(*) FROM Booking
WHERE machine_id = ? AND 
      ((start_time BETWEEN ? AND ?) OR 
       (end_time BETWEEN ? AND ?) OR
       (start_time <= ? AND end_time >= ?))
c. If no conflicts, insert a new record into the Booking table:

Generate a unique ID
Insert booking details (user_id, machine_id, start_time, end_time)
Set created_date to current timestamp
Set total_amount to 0 (will be updated later)


Starting a Machine (Transaction Creation):
a. When current time reaches booking start_time:

Insert a new record into the Transaction table:

Generate a unique ID
Set booking_id to the corresponding Booking ID
Set amount to 0 (will be updated later)
Set created_date and start_time to current timestamp
Leave end_time as null


Update Machine table:
sqlCopyUPDATE Machine SET isOn = true WHERE id = ?



Stopping a Machine (Manual):
a. User requests to stop the machine
b. Update the Transaction record:
sqlCopyUPDATE Transaction 
SET end_time = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE booking_id = ? AND end_time IS NULL
c. Calculate the amount:
sqlCopyUPDATE Transaction t
SET amount = (
  SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, t.start_time, t.end_time) * m.average_cost_per_hour
  FROM Booking b
  JOIN Machine m ON b.machine_id = m.id
  WHERE b.id = t.booking_id
)
WHERE t.booking_id = ? AND t.end_time IS NOT NULL
d. Update the Booking total_amount:
sqlCopyUPDATE Booking b
SET total_amount = (
  SELECT SUM(amount) 
  FROM Transaction 
  WHERE booking_id = b.id
)
WHERE id = ?
e. Update the Machine status:
sqlCopyUPDATE Machine SET isOn = false WHERE id = ?
f. Update the User balance:
sqlCopyUPDATE User u
SET balance = balance + (
  SELECT total_amount 
  FROM Booking 
  WHERE id = ?
)
WHERE id = ?

Automatic Machine Stop (Booking End Time):

Implement a scheduled job that runs every minute to check for expired bookings:
a. Find all active bookings where end_time has passed
b. For each booking, perform steps 6b to 6f


Finding User Bookings for a Specific Day:
sqlCopySELECT * FROM Booking
WHERE user_id = ? AND DATE(start_time) = ?
ORDER BY start_time

Calculating User Spending for a Specific Day:
sqlCopySELECT SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent
FROM Transaction t
JOIN Booking b ON t.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.user_id = ? AND DATE(t.created_date) = ?

Finding Available Slots for a Machine on a Specific Day:
a. Fetch all bookings for the machine on the given day:
sqlCopySELECT start_time, end_time 
FROM Booking
WHERE machine_id = ? AND DATE(start_time) = ?
ORDER BY start_time
b. Implement the following logic in your application:

Start with the full day (00:00 to 23:59)
For each booking:

If there's a gap between the current start time and the booking's start time, add it to available slots
Update the current start time to the booking's end time


If there's remaining time after the last booking, add it to available slots
c. Return the list of available slots


Efficient Querying of Bookings and Transactions:

Create composite indexes:
sqlCopyCREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_date ON Booking(user_id, start_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_booking_date ON Transaction(booking_id, created_date);

Use these indexes in your queries for better performance


Data Consistency and Transactions:

Wrap related database operations in transactions, especially for operations that update multiple tables (e.g., stopping a machine and updating related records)


Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms for all database operations
Log errors and exceptional cases for monitoring and debugging


Security:

Implement authentication and authorization checks before performing any operation
Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) before storing in the database


Scalability Considerations:

Monitor query performance and optimize as needed
Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
If the system grows significantly, consider sharding the database or implementing a distributed system architecture



By following these steps, you should be able to implement all the required business functionalities efficiently. Remember to thoroughly test each component, optimize based on real-world usage patterns, and continuously monitor the system's performance.
